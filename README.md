# Simple Programming Questions and Answers

I have organised a few simple programming questions and answers. Anyone can use this to practise simple programming concepts. I would encourage to read the questions and develop your own solutions, if required, refer to the answers mentioned in this repository.

# Strings

- 001 Find the first non-repeatd character in a string
- 002 Reverse a string iteratively
- 003 Reverse a string recursively
- 004 Check if string is a palindrome
- 005 Check if a string is composed of all unique characters
- 006 Determine if a string is an int or double
- 007 Print all permutations of a string

# Stack and Queue


# Trees

- 001 Implement a BST (Binary Search Tree) with insert and delete functions
- 002 Print a tree using Breadth First Search
- 003 Print a tree using Depth First Search
- 004 Find the smallest element in BST
- 005 Find the 2nd largest number in BST
- 006 Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
- 007 Print a tree by levels
- 008 Find the maximum distance between 2 nodes in a BST
- 009 Construct BST given the preorder and inorder traversal strings

# Sorting

- Implement bubble sort and mention the efficiency
- Implement selection sort and mention the efficiency
- Implement insertion sort  and mention the efficiency
- Implement merge sort and mention the efficiency
- Implement quick sort and mention the efficiency

# Linked lists

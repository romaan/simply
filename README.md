# Simple Programming Questions and Answers

I have organised a few simple programming questions and answers. Anyone can use this to practise simple programming concepts. I would encourage to read the questions and develop your own solutions, if required, refer to the answers mentioned in this repository.

# Numbers and bitwise operators

- 001 Swap two numbers
- 002 Reverse a number
- 003 Print all the prime numbers in the range 1 to N

# Strings

- 001 Find the first non-repeated character in a string
- 002 Reverse a string iteratively and recursively
- 003 Determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
- 004 Check if string is a palindrome
- 005 Check if a string is composed of all unique characters
- 006 Determine if a string is an int or double
- 007 Print all permutations of a string

# Stack and Queue

- 001 Perform stack operations using arrays
- 002 Perform queue operations using arrays


# Matrix

- 001 Add two matrices
- 002 Multiply two matrices
- 003 Rotate a matrix

# Trees

- 001 Implement a BST (Binary Search Tree) with insert and delete functions
- 002 Print a tree using Breadth First Search
- 003 Print a tree using Depth First Search
- 004 Find the smallest element in BST
- 005 Find the 2nd largest number in BST
- 006 Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
- 007 Print a tree by levels
- 008 Find the maximum distance between 2 nodes in a BST
- 009 Construct BST given the preorder and inorder traversal strings
